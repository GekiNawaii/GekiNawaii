## Hi there 👋
Name? Nguyễn Đức Anh. Geki Nawaii is my alias, but I prefer being called as Geki or "Nam"

Currently, I am a software engineering student at Hanoi University. 
Not good at anything, but I know some Java, a bit of C++ and a bit of Python. 
Having curiosity about any kind of tech, but knowledge just on the foundation level.

...maybe I'm not suit to be your co-worker, can we be friend?
